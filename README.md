## 1. Exploring the Database Structure. üëÄ 
My first approach for a clear understanding of the Northwind Database was to investigate the table schema including the individual column names, data types, maximum length for the text based columns, and finally constraints on each column. This was useful in allowing me to get a better understanding of each table's structure.  Tables like `Customers`, `Employees`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `Products`, `Suppliers`, and `Categories` tables were explored using this method.

## 2. Exploring Table Relationships in the Northwind Database. üîç
Understanding the relationships that exists among all tables in the database is key to performing accurate and insightful analyses. In this section, I further explored and documented the relationships that exist among all tables. This served as a foundational knowledge for how I approached all business questions and subsequent queries in the Northwind Database.

For this purpose, I used the following approaches:

### 2.1 Database Diagramming in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
#### Process: 
I created a new database diagram within SSMS and added key tables like `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `Products`, `Suppliers`, `Employees`, `Shippers`, and `Categories`.
In doing so `SSMS` automatically displays the foreign key relationships among tables and helped me to visualize representation of the table structure.

*Query and Output Screenshot.*
![](./images/explore2.1.png)

#### Outcome:
The diagram helped to revealed key relationships among table. For example; `orders` linked to `customers`, `order details` is tied to `orders` and `products`). This gave a big-picture view of the data structure and query approach.

### 2.2 Exploring Foreign Key Constraints Using SQL Queries:
#### Process: 
I used SQL queries to examine foreign key constraints directly. This provided details on child-parent table connections. This was helpful for confirming which fields link tables and informed me on how to approach my joint queries.

*Query and Output Screenshot.*
![](./images/explore2.2.png)

#### Query breakdown:
- **SELECT Clause**:
   - `ChildTable`: Displays the name of the table containing the foreign key (referred to as the "child" table).
   - `ChildColumn`: Shows the specific column in the child table that acts as the foreign key.
   - `ParentTable`: Lists the name of the table referenced by the foreign key (the "parent" table).
   - `ParentColumn`: Identifies the column in the parent table that is referenced by the foreign key.
- **JOIN Statements**:
   - The query joins `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS` with `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CONSTRAINT_COLUMN_USAGE` to access foreign key constraints and their associated columns.
- **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters results to show only foreign key constraints. this allows enforces only relationships between tables to be displayed.

#### Outcome: 
This query help provide the list of all relationships where one table (`the child`) references another table (`the parent`) via foreign key constraints. This help to give a clear map of dependencies within the database. A typical example is:
- `Orders.CustomerID` references `Customers.CustomerID`. This indicated a link between `customers` and their respective `orders`.
- `OrderDetails.OrderID` references `Orders.OrderID`. This also shows the connection between `order details` to `specific orders`.

### 2.3 Detailed Examination of Individual Table Relationships:
#### Process: 
I examined each table‚Äôs relationships in isolation using `sp_fkeys`. Using `sp_fkeys` on each table helped confirm how it references other tables or how it it is referenced by others.

Example just for the Orders Table. Note that this was done for all the tables.

*Query and Output Screenshot.*
![](./images/explore2.3.png)

#### Outcome:
Using this permitted me to see all references to the Orders table and also helped me to understand the dependencies and connections unique to each table.

### 2.4 Exploring Key Constraints in the Object Explorer:
#### Process: 
Finally I used the Object Explorer to further explore the Keys section under each table by right-clicking on each foreign key to view its `dependencies`.

*Screenshot for the orders table dependencies.*
![](./images/explore2.3.png)

#### Outcome:
This helped in viewing the relationships on a table-by-table basis and aided the confirmation of connections discovered in all the early approaches.

### Key Table Relationships Findings
Based on my analysis, below is a summary of the most significant findings I made with the Northwind Database.

| **Child Table**    | **Foreign Key**         | **Parent Table** | **Relationship Description**                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orders**         | Orders.CustomerID       | Customers        | Links each order to the customer who placed it.                       |
| **OrderDetails**   | OrderDetails.OrderID    | Orders           | Connects each line item to its associated order.                      |
| **OrderDetails**   | OrderDetails.ProductID  | Products         | Associates each line item with a specific product.                    |
| **Products**       | Products.SupplierID     | Suppliers        | Links each product to its supplier.                                   |
| **Products**       | Products.CategoryID     | Categories       | Organizes products into categories.                                   |

These discovered relationships will be the foundational tool for me to the Northwind database's structure and my guide to how tables interact for the various queries I will be using to answer the key business questions and bring the needed insights. This exploration step was neede as the main catalyst to an accurate and meaningful results in the overall project.
