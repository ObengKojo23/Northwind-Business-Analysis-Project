# **üìä 2. Data Exploration and Preparation**
<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

## 2.1 Exploring the Database Structure. üëÄ 
My first approach for a clear understanding of the Northwind Database was to investigate the table schema including the individual column names, data types, maximum length for the text based columns, and finally constraints on each column. This was useful in allowing me to get a better understanding of each table's structure.  Tables like `Customers`, `Employees`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `Products`, `Suppliers`, and `Categories` tables were explored using this method.

## 2.2 Exploring Table Relationships in the Northwind Database. üîç
Understanding the relationships that exists among all tables in the database is key to performing accurate and insightful analyses. In this section, I further explored and documented the relationships that exist among all tables. This served as a foundational knowledge for how I approached all business questions and subsequent queries in the Northwind Database.

For this purpose, I used the following approaches:

### 2.2.1 Database Diagramming in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
- ### Process:
  I created a new database diagram within SSMS and added key tables like `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `Products`, `Suppliers`, `Employees`, `Shippers`, and `Categories`.
In doing so `SSMS` automatically displays the foreign key relationships among tables and helped me to visualize representation of the table structure.

*Query and Output Screenshot.*
![](./images/explore2.1.png)

- ### Outcome:
  The diagram helped to reveal the key relationships among table. For example; `orders` linked to `customers`, `order details` is tied to `orders` and `products`). This gave a big-picture view of the data structure and query approach.

### 2.2.2 Exploring Foreign Key Constraints Using SQL Queries:
- ### Process:
  I used SQL queries to examine foreign key constraints directly. This provided details on child-parent table connections. This was helpful for confirming which fields link tables and informed me on how to approach my joint queries.

*Query and Output Screenshot.*
![](./images/explore2.2.png)

### Query breakdown:
- **SELECT Clause**:
   - `ChildTable`: Displays the name of the table containing the foreign key (referred to as the "child" table).
   - `ChildColumn`: Shows the specific column in the child table that acts as the foreign key.
   - `ParentTable`: Lists the name of the table referenced by the foreign key (the "parent" table).
   - `ParentColumn`: Identifies the column in the parent table that is referenced by the foreign key.
- **JOIN Statements**:
   - The query joins `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS` with `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CONSTRAINT_COLUMN_USAGE` to access foreign key constraints and their associated columns.
- **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters results to show only foreign key constraints. this allows enforces only relationships between tables to be displayed.

- ### Outcome:
  This query help provide the list of all relationships where one table (`the child`) references another table (`the parent`) via foreign key constraints. This help to give a clear map of dependencies within the database. A typical example is:
- `Orders.CustomerID` references `Customers.CustomerID`. This indicated a link between `customers` and their respective `orders`.
- `OrderDetails.OrderID` references `Orders.OrderID`. This also shows the connection between `order details` to `specific orders`.

### 2.2.3 Detailed Examination of Individual Table Relationships:
- ### Process:
  I examined each table‚Äôs relationships in isolation using `sp_fkeys`. Using `sp_fkeys` on each table helped confirm how it references other tables or how it is referenced by others.

Example just for the Orders Table. Note that this was done for all the tables.

*Query and Output Screenshot.*
![](./images/explore2.3.png)

- ### Outcome:
  Using this permitted me to see all references to the Orders table and also helped me to understand the dependencies and connections unique to each table.

### 2.2.4 Exploring Key Constraints in the Object Explorer:
- ### Process:
  Finally I used the Object Explorer to further explore the Keys section under each table by right-clicking on each foreign key to view its `dependencies`.

*Screenshot for the orders table dependencies.*
![](./images/explore2.4.png)

- ### Outcome:
  This helped in viewing the relationships on a table-by-table basis and aided the confirmation of connections discovered in all the early approaches.

### Key Table Relationships Findings
Based on my analysis, below is a summary of the most significant findings I made with the Northwind Database.

| **Child Table**    | **Foreign Key**         | **Parent Table** | **Relationship Description**                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orders**         | Orders.CustomerID       | Customers        | Links each order to the customer who placed it.                       |
| **OrderDetails**   | OrderDetails.OrderID    | Orders           | Connects each line item to its associated order.                      |
| **OrderDetails**   | OrderDetails.ProductID  | Products         | Associates each line item with a specific product.                    |
| **Products**       | Products.SupplierID     | Suppliers        | Links each product to its supplier.                                   |
| **Products**       | Products.CategoryID     | Categories       | Organizes products into categories.                                   |

These discovered relationships will be the foundational tool for me to the Northwind database's structure and my guide to how tables interact for the various queries I will be using to answer the key business questions and bring the needed insights. This exploration step was needed as the main catalyst to an accurate and meaningful results in the overall project.

## Q6: How do discounts affect the order frequency and quantity of purchased products‚ùî
*Query and Output Screenshot:*

![q6 image](./images/q6.png)

### Output Explanation:
I used this query to categorize orders into two types based on whether a discount was applied or not. I used a `CASE` statement to label orders as either "Discounted" or "Non-Discounted." I then aggregated data to count the number of distinct orders (`OrderCount`), calculate the total quantity of products ordered (`TotalQuantity`), and found the average quantity per order (`AvgQuantity`). By grouping the results based on the discount type, the analysis compared the behavior of discounted versus non-discounted orders.

### üåüKey Insights:
- **Discounted Orders**: There were `380` orders with a discount, with a total quantity of `22,718` products purchased and an average of `27` units per order.  
- **Non-Discounted Orders**: There were `613` orders without discounts, with a total of `28,599` products purchased and an average of `21` units per order.  
- **Impact of Discounts**: Orders with discounts have a *lower frequency* (`380` orders) compared to non-discounted orders (`613` orders). However, discounted orders have a **higher average quantity** of products per order (`27` units) compared to non-discounted orders (`21` units).
  - The total quantity for discounted orders is only slightly lower (`22,718` vs `28,599`), but this is offset by fewer orders in the discounted category.

### üìåRecommendations:
- **Increase Frequency of Discount Offers**: Northwind needs to increase the number of discounted orders by offering more frequent or targeted promotions. By expanding the reach of discount offers, Northwind can boost the overall order count, maintaining higher order volume and sales.

## Q7: What percentage of orders include a discount, and how does it impact overall revenue‚ùî
*Query and Output Screenshot:*

![q7 image](./images/q7.png)

### Output Explanation:
I usde this query to calculate two key metrics: 1. the percentage of orders that include a discount and 2. the overall impact of those discounts on the revenue. It works by first counting the number of orders in the `OrderDetails` table where the `Discount` is greater than 0 and dividing it by the total number of orders. Multiplying by 100 returned the percentage of orders with discounts. The query also calculated the total revenue from orders that included a discount (**DiscountedRevenue**) and compares it with the total revenue from all orders (**TotalRevenue**).

### üåüKey Insights:
- `38.89%` of the orders in the dataset included a discount.
- The `discounted revenue` amounts to `$1,265,793.04`, while the `total revenue` from all orders is `$1,354,458.59`. This means that `discounted orders` contributed to approximately `93.44%` of the total revenue. This is an indication of a significant impact of discounts on overall sales.
- The results highlight that while fewer orders received discounts, these orders ended up making up a large portion of the revenue. This suggests that discounting is a powerful tool for driving higher-value sales.

### üìåRecommendations:
- **Optimize Discount Thresholds**: Northwind needs to increase minimum purchase requirements for discounts to maintain revenue while reducing potential profit loss.
- **Targeted Discounting**: Northwind needs to offer discounts on high-margin products or underperforming items to maximize revenue without over-discounting popular products.

*Query and Output Screenshot:*

![q10 image](./images/q10.png)

### Output Explanation:
I used this query to calculate the customer retention rate over a given period by analyzing the frequency of orders placed by each customer. I began by creating a common table expression (`CustomerOrders`) that counts the total number of orders for each customer in the `Orders` table. I then used it in the main to determine the percentage of customers who have placed more than one order (indicating retained customers) by dividing the count of such customers by the total number of customers and finally formatting the result as a percentage.

### üåüKey Insights:
- The customer retention rate is high, with `98.88%` of customers placing multiple orders.
- The high retention rate indicates that Northwind has strong customer loyalty and repeat purchasing behavior. This may suggest satisfaction with the products, services offered and other factors.
- This insight could be leveraged to enhance customer lifetime value by focusing on personalized promotions, loyalty programs, or incentives to maintain or further improve the retention rate.

### üìåRecommendation:
Northwind should implement (if not already) or improve their **Customer Loyalty Program** to incentivize repeat purchases and increase customer engagement.

### üí•Impact Analysis:
- **Boost Customer Lifetime Value**: Rewards to customers for thier frequent purchases can increase average revenue per customer.
- **Enhance Brand Loyalty**: A loyalty program strengthens customer commitment and retention.
- **Drive Revenue Growth**: Incentives for repeat purchases can increase order frequency and size.

*Query and Output Screenshot:*

![q11 image](./images/q11.png)

### Output Explanation:
I used this query to calculate the average processing time for each employee by first determining the processing time for each order (the difference between `OrderDate` and `ShippedDate`). I then aggregated this information to calculate the average processing time per employee. Finally, I sorted the results by `AvgProcessingTime`, which provided a ranking of employees based on their efficiency in processing orders.

### üåüKey Insights:
- **Nancy Davolio** and **Steven Buchanan** are the most efficient employees, with an average processing time of `7`.
- **Andrew Fuller**, **Laura Callahan*, **Margaret Peacock**, **Janet Leverling**, **Robert King**, and **Michael Suyama** have an average processing time of `8`, which suggests that their order processing is slightly slower compared to `Nancy` and `Steven`.
- **Anne Dodsworth** has the slowest processing time, with an average of `10`. This indicates that there may be room for improvement in her order processing efficiency.

### üìåRecommendations:
- **Training for Slow Processors**: Provide additional training to employees with slower processing times like `Anne Dodsworth` to help improve her efficiency.
- **Process Optimization**: Streamline order processing steps for employees with higher average times to reduce delays.
- **Performance Incentives**: Offer rewards or recognition for top performers like `Nancy Davolio` and `Steven Buchanan` to maintain high productivity levels and encourage other employee to emulate.

### üí•Impact Analysis:
- **Faster Order Fulfillment**: Improving processing times will result in quicker deliveries, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
- **Resource Allocation**: By identifying slower processors, resources can be allocated to provide targeted support, boosting overall efficiency.
- **Employee Morale**: Recognizing high performers and providing training for others will foster a positive work environment and encourage continuous improvement.

<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

In this project, I used the Northwind database to analyze key business metrics which helped me to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and employee productivity. Through SQL queries, I identified top customers, evaluated sales trends, and assessed the impact of discounts on order frequency and quantity.

## Key findings include:
- **Customer Engagement**: Customers with higher order frequencies contribute significantly to overall revenue of Northwind Trader. This suggests that engagement strategies should focus on repeat buyers.
- **Employee Productivity**: Employees who process orders faster are linked to improved operational efficiency. This could lead to better customer satisfaction and quicker delivery times.
- **Discount Strategy**: Discounts had a positive effect on both order frequency and total quantity purchased. This indicates that targeted discount strategies can help in driving bulk buying and increase sales volume.

This analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making and showcases how practical insights can inform business strategies and optimize operations. Through this project, I showcased my ability to use both basic and complex SQL for data extraction and data aggregations and ultimately providing actionable recommendations for business growth.
