# Requirements for Northwind Database Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing the Northwind database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Below are the necessary requirements and setup instructions.

## Requirements

1. **SQL Server**: Ensure you have SQL Server installed. [Download SQL Server here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
   
2. **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: SSMS is needed for writing and executing SQL queries against the Northwind database. [Download SSMS here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16).

3. **Northwind Database**: You will need to have the Northwind sample database installed on your SQL Server instance. Follow these steps:
   - Download the Northwind database script from [Microsoft's SQL Server samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs).
   - Run the `.sql` script in SSMS to create the database.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install SQL Server and SSMS**:
   - Install SQL Server and configure it according to your environmentâ€™s specifications.
   - Install SSMS, which will be used to connect to the SQL Server and execute queries.

2. **Create the Northwind Database**:
   - Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance.
   - Open the Northwind `.sql` script file.
   - Execute the script to create and populate the Northwind database.

3. **Start the Analysis**:
   - Use SSMS to write and execute SQL queries on the Northwind database.
   - Save queries and document insights as needed for the project portfolio.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to regularly back up your SQL database if you're making changes.
- For more information on using SSMS, check [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms).

This setup will prepare your environment to conduct in-depth SQL analysis on the Northwind database using SSMS.
